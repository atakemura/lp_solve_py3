# lp_solve_py3
lp_solve for Python 3+

This project is intended to be a replacement for the Python package that is distributed with the official lp_solve source.

The original Python package was intended for Python 2.x, and thus causes problems when building with Python 3.x.

Current target is lp_solve ver. 5.5.2.5 https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.5/

The base sources are available from the lp_solve sourceforge site.

1. lp_solve 5.5.2.5 https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.5/lp_solve_5.5.2.5_source.tar.gz/download
2. lp_solve Python https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.5/lp_solve_5.5.2.5_Python_source.tar.gz/download

Tested on continuumio/anaconda3:latest Docker image.
